I want to create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Node.js that connects to my task backend API.  
The MCP server should:

1. Connect to the REST API I already built (running on localhost:3000).
   - GET /tasks
   - GET /tasks/:id
   - GET /tasks/:id/related
   - POST /tasks/:id/export

2. Expose MCP tools to Cursor/Copilot:
   - `listTasks` → fetch tasks and return them as JSON.
   - `getTask` → get details of a task by ID.
   - `findRelatedTasks` → return related tasks for a given task ID.
   - `exportTaskDoc` → trigger export and return the Markdown content.

3. Use Node.js with TypeScript if possible.
4. Provide a `server.ts` file as the main entry point.
5. Include configuration so that Cursor/Copilot can connect to this MCP server directly.
6. Return responses in a structured JSON format so that the editor can consume them easily.

Please generate the full boilerplate code for this MCP server with proper folder structure and stubs for each tool.
